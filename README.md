# TreeGrapher - Visualize Data Structures
_This app will graph any N-ary tree the user need._

## Features

* Serialize a tree given by code.
* Deserialize a tree given a string by code.
* Shows the tree builded.

## Future change
* Implements guidelines between sibling nodes, for a better visual experience.
* Allow the user to write or paste the tree serialized in order to graph it.


I'm still working on this project, the current development point is this:
